Strictly follow this path mapping:
```json

    "CONTEXT.md": ".docs/CONTEXT.md",
    "CONTEXT-MAP.md": ".docs/CONTEXT-MAP.md",
    "docs/adr/": ".docs/adr",
    "docs/.scratch/": ".docs/.scratch",
    "per_context_CONTEXT.md": "<context>/.docs/CONTEXT.md",
    "per_context_docs/adr/": "<context>/.docs/adr",
    "ARCH-FROM-AI.md": ".docs/<scope-name>/ARCH-FROM-AI.md"
  },
  "outputs": {
    "prd": ".docs/prd",
    "issue": ".docs/issues",
    "handoff": ".docs/HANDOFF.md",
    "temporary": ".docs/.tmp",
    "architecture_report": ".docs/.tmp/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html",

  },
  "configs": {
    "issue_tracker": ".docs/agents/issue-tracker.md"
  }
}
```

I don't know this area of code well. Go up a layer of abstraction. Give me a map of all the relevant modules and callers, using the project's domain glossary vocabulary.
